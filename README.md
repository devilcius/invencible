# DJ Imbencible

> *Good taste is not dead. It’s just been dancing in strange places.*

A minimal web landing for DJ Imbencible — half enlightened, half prophet of error. Power pop, indie rock, shoegaze, northern soul, new wave and everything that glows between.

Built with React and TailwindCSS, because rebellion also deserves clean code.

Includes a few things that shouldn’t work but do: a carousel of classics, fake testimonials, and a questionable personality quiz for those who mistake irony for depth.

You can visit it at [imbencible.com](imbencible.com).
